## Fixed Issues

- ✅ **Script Loading Dependencies**: Fixed the "unable to load News" error across all category pages
- ✅ **File Structure**: Moved all website files to root directory for proper GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ **Real-time News**: Integrated multiple news APIs (GNews, NewsData, NewsAPI, Mediastack, CurrentsAPI)
- ✅ **RSS Feeds**: Added comprehensive RSS feed sources for all categories
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Implemented robust retry logic and fallback mechanisms

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit all files to your main branch
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to Settings > Pages > Deploy from main branch
3. **Access Website**: Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io`

## Category Pages Fixed

All these pages now load real-time news properly:

- Health (`/health.html`)
- Lifestyle (`/lifestyle.html`)
- Technology (`/technology.html`)
- Entertainment (`/entertainment.html`)
- World News (`/world.html`)
